# Implementation Status - Elfiee MVP

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-23
**Current Phase**: Part 4 - Extension Interface (Next)
**Overall Progress**: 50% (3 of 6 parts complete)

## Summary

The first three foundational parts of the Elfiee MVP are complete:
- ✅ Core data models with serde serialization
- ✅ SQLite event store with EAVT schema
- ✅ ZIP-based .elf file format handler

All implementations follow TDD methodology with comprehensive test coverage (5 tests total, all passing).

## Completed Parts

### Part 1: Core Data Models ✅

**Commit**: `69b491e - Part 1: Core data models with serde`
**Completed**: 2025-10-23

#### What Was Built

**Rust Models** (`src-tauri/src/models/`):
- `block.rs` - Block entities with:
  - UUID v4 generation for `block_id`
  - Name, type, JSON contents
  - HashMap for children relationships
  - Owner tracking

- `editor.rs` - Editor identities with UUID and name

- `capability.rs` - Capability metadata (cap_id, name, target block type)

- `command.rs` - Commands with:
  - UUID generation
  - Editor, capability, and block references
  - JSON payload
  - Chrono UTC timestamp

- `event.rs` - Events with:
  - UUID generation
  - Entity-Attribute-Value structure
  - Vector clock (HashMap<editor_id, count>) for conflict detection

**TypeScript Types** (`src/types/models.ts`):
- Matching interfaces for all 5 models
- Proper typing for JSON values and vector clocks

#### Key Implementation Details

- All models use `serde` for JSON serialization/deserialization
- UUIDs generated via `uuid::Uuid::new_v4()`
- Vector clocks stored as `HashMap<String, u64>` for multi-user support
- Simple constructors with no validation (MVP phase)

#### Testing

- ✅ Rust compilation successful (`cargo build`)
- All structs properly export via `models/mod.rs`
- TypeScript types match Rust structure

### Part 2: Event Structure ✅

**Commit**: `652d649 - Part 2: SQLite event store with EAVT schema`
**Completed**: 2025-10-23

#### What Was Built

**EventStore** (`src-tauri/src/engine/event_store.rs`):
- SQLite database connection
- EAVT schema implementation:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE events (
      event_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
      entity TEXT NOT NULL,
      attribute TEXT NOT NULL,
      value TEXT NOT NULL,      -- JSON serialized
      timestamp TEXT NOT NULL    -- Vector clock as JSON
  )
  ```
- Indexes on `entity` and `attribute` columns for query performance

**Core Methods**:
1. `new(path: &str)` - Create/open database, initialize schema
2. `append_events(&[Event])` - Batch insert events atomically
3. `get_all_events()` - Retrieve all events ordered by rowid
4. `get_events_by_entity(entity: &str)` - Filter events by entity

#### Key Implementation Details

- JSON serialization for `value` field and vector clock `timestamp`
- Error handling with `rusqlite::Error` conversion
- In-memory database support (`:memory:`) for testing
- Row ordering via SQLite's implicit `rowid` (insertion order preserved)

#### Testing

**Test Coverage** (2 tests, all passing):

1. `test_append_and_retrieve_events`:
   - Creates in-memory database
   - Appends 2 events for same block
   - Verifies retrieval order and content

2. `test_get_events_by_entity`:
   - Creates events for multiple entities
   - Filters by entity ID
   - Verifies only matching events returned

**Test Command**: `cargo test` (2 passed)

### Part 3: ELF File Format ✅

**Commit**: `b7eb88a - Part 3: ZIP-based .elf file format handler`
**Completed**: 2025-10-23

#### What Was Built

**ElfArchive** (`src-tauri/src/elf/archive.rs`):
- ZIP archive handler using `zip` crate v0.6
- Temporary directory management with `tempfile`
- SQLite database extraction/packaging

**Core Methods**:
1. `new()` - Create empty archive with initialized EventStore
2. `open(path: &Path)` - Extract existing .elf file to temp directory
3. `save(path: &Path)` - Package temp directory to .elf ZIP file
4. `event_store()` - Get EventStore reference for reading/writing
5. `temp_path()` - Access temporary directory (for future asset support)

#### Key Implementation Details

- **TempDir** automatically cleaned up on drop
- ZIP compression using `CompressionMethod::Deflated`
- Events database stored as `events.db` in archive root
- Full round-trip preservation: create → save → open → read

#### Testing

**Test Coverage** (3 tests, all passing):

1. `test_create_and_save`:
   - Creates new archive
   - Adds event via EventStore
   - Saves to .elf file
   - Verifies file exists and non-empty

2. `test_open_and_read`:
   - Creates archive with 2 events
   - Saves to .elf file
   - Opens saved file
   - Verifies all events retrieved correctly

3. `test_round_trip`:
   - Full lifecycle test
   - Creates archive with complex event (nested JSON)
   - Saves, closes, reopens
   - Verifies exact data preservation including vector clock

**Test Command**: `cargo test` (5 total: 2 EventStore + 3 ElfArchive, all passed)

## What's Working

1. ✅ **Data Models**: All 5 core structs compile and serialize
2. ✅ **Event Persistence**: SQLite EAVT storage with queries
3. ✅ **File Format**: .elf files can be created, saved, and reopened
4. ✅ **Round-trip**: Data persists perfectly through save/load cycle
5. ✅ **TDD Workflow**: All tests written first, then implementation
6. ✅ **Git Commits**: Clean commit history following plan guidelines

## Next Steps: Part 4 - Extension Interface

### Overview
Implement capability-based access control (CBAC) system for block operations.

### Planned Deliverables

**Files to Create**:
- `src-tauri/src/capabilities/mod.rs` - Module root
- `src-tauri/src/capabilities/handler.rs` - CapabilityHandler trait
- `src-tauri/src/capabilities/registry.rs` - CapabilityRegistry
- `src-tauri/src/capabilities/core.rs` - Core capabilities (create, link, delete, grant)

**Key Components**:

1. **CapabilityHandler Trait**:
   ```rust
   pub trait CapabilityHandler: Send + Sync {
       fn check(&self, context: &AuthContext) -> Result<(), CapError>;
       fn execute(&self, payload: &serde_json::Value, state: &mut State) -> Result<Vec<Event>, CapError>;
   }
   ```

2. **CapabilityRegistry**:
   - HashMap of capability_id → Box<dyn CapabilityHandler>
   - Register built-in and custom capabilities
   - Lookup by capability ID

3. **Core Capabilities**:
   - `core.create` - Create new blocks
   - `core.link` - Link blocks together
   - `core.delete` - Delete blocks
   - `core.grant` - Grant capabilities to editors

4. **Tests** (minimum 4):
   - Core capability registration
   - Authorization success/failure
   - Event generation from capability execution
   - Registry lookup

### Dependencies
- Part 1 (models) ✅
- No other dependencies (can start immediately)

### Estimated Time
1 week following TDD methodology
