# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Code Quality Compliance
- [ ] All Rust code will use `clippy` and `rustfmt` for static analysis and formatting
- [ ] React code will use ESLint and Prettier for consistency and quality checks
- [ ] All public APIs will have complete documentation comments
- [ ] Code complexity will be kept within maintainable limits

### Testing Standards Verification
- [ ] TDD approach will be followed: Tests first → User approval → Tests fail → Then implement
- [ ] Rust backend will have unit tests covering core business logic
- [ ] React frontend components will have unit and integration tests
- [ ] All user scenarios will be verified through end-to-end testing

### User Experience Consistency
- [ ] Shadcn/ui component library will be used to ensure visual consistency
- [ ] All interactions will meet modern desktop application user expectations
- [ ] Responsive design principles will apply to different screen sizes
- [ ] Error handling and loading states will have unified user experience
- [ ] Accessibility standards will meet WCAG 2.1 AA level

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Focus on clarifying application design and basic business logic
- [ ] Avoid unnecessary performance optimizations that may obscure code logic
- [ ] Performance optimization should only be done when absolutely necessary
- [ ] Prioritize code clarity over performance unless performance is critical

### Technology Stack Alignment
- [ ] Rust will be used as backend core language, React + TypeScript as frontend framework
- [ ] Shadcn/ui will be used as UI component library
- [ ] State management will use React Context only, avoiding over-engineering
- [ ] Data persistence will use SQLite (via Tauri plugin) or local file system
- [ ] Unnecessary dependencies and complexity will be avoided

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
